APP-GRAPHICS-ImgMeta
====================

With ImgMeta you can add your own information to any image-file, to describe them better than its pure filename can. These information (so called meta-data) are stored in the 'Extended Attributes' (EA) of the file (read more about EAs and their special considerations ).
